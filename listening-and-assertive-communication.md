## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)
  - **Empathy**: Reflective listening is all about showing empathy. It means really trying to understand how the other person feels.

  - **Repeating and Clarifying**: You repeat what the other person says to show that you're paying attention. This helps clarify what they mean.

  - **No Judgment or Advice**: When using reflective listening, you don't judge or offer solutions. You let the speaker express themselves without interruption.

  - **Non-Verbal Cues**: You use non-verbal cues, like nodding or maintaining eye contact, to show that you're engaged in the conversation.
